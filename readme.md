## Creating a Simple Go Web Server

We'll create a simple web application in Go for demonstration in this article. This application will:
* Expose routes for the index route,
* Serve up a basic HTML page for /, and
* Use a configuration file to customize the application.

## Directory Structure
Upon completion, there will only be three files within your temporary folder and the directory structure will look like:
 - Dockerfile -- Docker configurations go in here
 - index.html -- HTML page just to show that your Docker container works and can serve up a webpage
 - main.go -- GoLang app that serves up index.html
