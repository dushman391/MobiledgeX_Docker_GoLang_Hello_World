## Creating a Simple Go Web Server

We'll create a simple web application in Go for demonstration in this article. This application will:
* Expose routes for the index route,
* Serve up a basic HTML page for /, and
* Use a configuration file to customize the application.

## Final Directory Structure
Upon completion, the directory structure will look like:
+-- _
|   +-- Dockerfile
|   +-- index.html
|   +-- main.go
